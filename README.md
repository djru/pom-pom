# PomPom is a simple pomodoro timer written in React.js
## Why'd you make this?
I made Pom Pom because I've been wanting to try the pomodoro method for a while, and I wanted to learn the new hooks feature in React.

## Why doesn't this work on iPhone?
iOS stops JavaScript execution when the phone goes to sleep, so the timer won't persist in the background. Push notifications are also not allowed from JavaScript on iOS.
